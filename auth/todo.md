Guidelines:

1. Api will maintain versions !
2. Add next task in this file to track, what is remained.
3. Always Format code before commits, pushing, using simple commands in the appropiate project dir as this repo will contain multiple service and folder, we will sort that thing soon with monorepo or workspaces, whatever you are familiar with.

- commands to check if there are unformatted files => npm run format:check
- commands to format all the unformatted files in project => npm run format
  Todo:

1. Create starter for auth controllers {routes and controller}
2. Cors {finish it}
3. Create a Docker file to create one command deployable app
